I'm Peter, a soon-to-be full-stack developer. I'm a multilingual Oxford graduate, offering enthusiasm, work ethic, and a blend of soft and hard skills. I see a world teeming with opportunities, and am restless to pursue them. I want to work on radical ideas with other relentlessly ambitious people.

How did I come to study at Makers? After graduating from Oxford with a 2.i in Spanish and Arabic, I moved to London and began working for the digital executive search firm, [The Up Group](http://www.theupgroup.com/). Unsure what I wanted to do upon leaving university, I was attracted to Up by its roster of clients: Just Eat, Airbnb, Google, and Etsy to name a few. Tech companies were exciting to me, and my role at Up allowed me to cultivate this passion, as well as begin to learn to code in earnest in my spare time - something I had been meaning to do for years, which the pressures of academia had made impractical until that point.

During my near-18 months at Up, working with some of Europe's most creative, pioneering businesses gave me an itch to jump in and get involved, rather than watching on from (an admittedly incredible seat on) the sidelines. This dovetailed perfectly with my increasing abilities in and enjoyment of coding, which I had been practising on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Having researched around various options, including other coding bootcamps, for the best route into this career path with no technical experience and a professional services background, I eventually applied to Makers. From its language-agnostic approach to its community-driven ethos, Makers held a number of attractions.

#### Communication

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

As a linguist throughout my academic career, the import of precise, clear, and concise education is not lost on me. A combination of essay-writing and Oxford's tutorial system (hour-long sessions of tuition between a tutor and up to four students) helped me develop both my oral and written communication.

In my first job with The Up Group, part of my remit was to not only disseminate industry news to the team wider team, but also explain *why* a given story was important. In addition to this, I was also responsible for training new starters in the use of our database system. This entailed explaining not only how and to what en the database was used on a daily basis, but also the meaning of different tags for records on the database, such as industry or function; for experienced hires, these were often obvious, but to many of the graduate-level hires, it meant introducing them to brand new concepts.
