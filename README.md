I'm Peter, a soon-to-be full-stack developer. I'm a multilingual Oxford graduate, offering enthusiasm, work ethic, and a blend of soft and hard skills. I see a world teeming with opportunities, and am restless to pursue them. I want to work on radical ideas with other relentlessly ambitious people.

How did I come to study at Makers? After graduating from Oxford with a 2.i in Spanish and Arabic, I moved to London and began working for the digital executive search firm, [The Up Group](http://www.theupgroup.com/). Unsure what I wanted to do upon leaving university, I was attracted to Up by its roster of clients: Just Eat, Airbnb, Google, and Etsy to name a few. Tech companies were exciting to me, and my role at Up allowed me to cultivate this passion, as well as begin to learn to code in earnest in my spare time - something I had been meaning to do for years, which the pressures of academia had made impractical until that point.

During my near-18 months at Up, working with some of Europe's most creative, pioneering businesses gave me an itch to jump in and get involved, rather than watching on from (an admittedly incredible seat on) the sidelines. This dovetailed perfectly with my increasing abilities in and enjoyment of coding, which I had been practising on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Having researched around various options, including other coding bootcamps, for the best route into this career path with no technical experience and a professional services background, I eventually applied to Makers. From its language-agnostic approach to its community-driven ethos, Makers held a number of attractions.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.
