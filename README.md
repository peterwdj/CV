I'm Peter, a soon-to-be full-stack developer. I'm a multilingual Oxford graduate, offering enthusiasm, work ethic, and a blend of soft and hard skills. I see a world teeming with opportunities, and am restless to pursue them. I want to work on radical ideas with other relentlessly ambitious people.

How did I come to study at Makers? After graduating from Oxford with a 2.i in Spanish and Arabic, I moved to London and began working for the digital executive search firm, [The Up Group](http://www.theupgroup.com/). Unsure what I wanted to do upon leaving university, I was attracted to Up by its roster of clients: Just Eat, Airbnb, Google, and Etsy to name a few. Tech companies were exciting to me, and my role at Up allowed me to cultivate this passion, as well as begin to learn to code in earnest in my spare time - something I had been meaning to do for years, which the pressures of academia had made impractical until that point.

During my near-18 months at Up, working with some of Europe's most creative, pioneering businesses gave me an itch to jump in and get involved, rather than watching on from (an admittedly incredible seat on) the sidelines. This dovetailed perfectly with my increasing abilities in and enjoyment of coding, which I had been practising on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Having researched around various options, including other coding bootcamps, for the best route into this career path with no technical experience and a professional services background, I eventually applied to Makers. From its language-agnostic approach to its community-driven ethos, Makers held a number of attractions.

#### Communication

As a linguist throughout my academic career, the import of precise, clear, and concise education is not lost on me. A combination of essay-writing and Oxford's tutorial system (hour-long sessions of tuition between a tutor and up to four students) helped me develop both my oral and written communication.

In my first job with The Up Group, part of my remit was to not only disseminate industry news to the team wider team, but also explain *why* a given story was important. In addition to this, I was also responsible for training new starters in the use of our database system. This entailed explaining not only how and to what end the database was used on a daily basis, but also the meaning of different tags for records on the database, such as industry or function; for experienced hires, these were often obvious, but to many of the graduate-level hires, it meant introducing them to brand new concepts.   

#### Aptitude for learning

Throughout my life, I have always had an insatiable curiosity that has driven my desire to learn. From being moved up a year group during Year 1 English classes within a few weeks of the start of the year, to teaching myself basic Hindi during the summer of 2015, I have always found great satisfaction in pushing myself to tackle new concepts.

Throughout academia, this often meant new languages, and having studied French, German, Spanish, and Italian to varying levels pre-university, I was motivated to learn a non-European language precisely for the challenge it represented. Whilst working at The Up Group, this meant developing a deep understanding for the UK and Europe's digital ecosystem to assist with business development pitches and tricky searches. Over my 18 months at the company, I established myself as the go-to person to explain in-vogue concepts such as blockchain and deep learning.

#### Getting Stuff Done *(capital G, S, D)*

Throughout my life, I have always placed a heavy emphasis on Getting Stuff Done, no matter how difficult or unpleasant the task at hand may have been. At university, I never once missed a task or essay deadline. Meanwhile at The Up Group, I often worked in an ad-hoc way, having to complete tasks as they came in, in addition to working on ongoing projects.

In practice, this has always involved lots of management: of time, of stakeholders, and of myself. The end result of this was usually that I completed the task promptly and to a high standard. However, on occasions when either overall workloads or simple timeframes meant that It would not have been possible for me to complete a task to a sufficiently high standard, I have worked with either colleagues or tutors to ensure that tasks were completed, either at a later date for non-time-sensitive tasks, or to be assisted by someone who had the capacity to do so for urgent ones. A strong work ethic, ruthless prioritisation, and a preparedness to be flexible have been absolutely critical in my ability to Get Stuff Done.

#### Makers Academy (October 2017 - January 2018)
##### Full stack development bootcamp

I began at Makers Academy, Europe's leading web developer bootcamp, after having taught myself to code in my spare time for the past year. The course is highly competitive, accepting only 10% of applicants, and places a heavy emphasis on practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and object-oriented design. See Makers' [website](http://www.makersacademy.com/curriculum/) for more on their curriculum.

#### Somerville College, University of Oxford (October 2012 - June 2016)
##### BA European and Middle Eastern Languages (Spanish & Arabic)

I graduated from Oxford with a 2.i in EMEL (Spanish & Arabic) in June 2016 after a four year course, including a year abroad in Amman, Jordan, where I attended an intensive course in Modern Standard and Classical Arabic. I also spent time in Spain during two summers across my degree, working at a delivery startup and a small healthcare consultancy.

During my degree, I covered a wide and diverse range of historical and literary content in addition to language work, ranging from pre-Islamic poetry to modern Spanish theatre. I also engaged with a wide range of extra-curricular activities, including working as a Section Editor for VERSA News, a student media outlet, captaining my college's 2nd XI football team, and taking leadership roles within the JCR, in the position of JCR Secretary.  

#### Hills Road Sixth-Form College
##### A-Level Studies
During my time at Hills Road, I took full A-Levels in four subjects, achieving an A\* in History, As in Spanish and Government & Politics, and a B in German. I also took on an additional GCSE in Italian in my second year, achieving an A\* grade.

#### Swavesey Village College
##### GCSEs
I took my GCSEs at my local secondary school, Swavesey Village College, achieving nine A\*s, three As, one B, and three Distinctions. I was also awarded the Chair of Governor's Award at the school's awards ceremony for the year group.

One of my primary interests is coding - but you've already heard all about that above. My motivation to learn to code came from another of my passions - startups. I am enthralled by the small band of believers who see opportunities to change the world for the better - and then go out and do it. It was a privilege for me to be able to cultivate that passion during my time at The Up Group.

Outside of the worlds of technology and entrepreneurship, I have a keen interest in politics, which was nurtured by my parents from an early age. I also play football twice a week (training and competitively), and this has allowed me to grow my leadership abilities, confidence, and physical health.
