I'm Peter, and I'm a full-stack developer, having graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) in January 2018. I'm a multilingual Oxford graduate bringing enthusiasm and work ethic, seeking a position at a truly mission-driven startup. I am currently working on a couple of side projects, such as [TeamGen](https://github.com/peterwdj/football-team-generator) with [ideas for more](https://github.com/peterwdj/projects).

## How I Got Here
[Bio](#how-i-got-here) | [Skills](#skills) | [Education](#education) | [Experience](#experience) | [Sample Projects](#sample-projects) [Interests](#interests)

After graduating from Oxford with a 2.i in Spanish and Arabic, I moved to London and began working for the digital executive search firm, [The Up Group](http://www.theupgroup.com/). Unsure what I wanted to do upon leaving university, I was attracted to Up by its roster of clients, such as Just Eat, Airbnb, Google, and Etsy. Tech companies were exciting to me, and my role at Up allowed me to cultivate this passion, and spurred by this, I began to teach myself to code in my spare time.

During my time at Up, working with some of Europe's most creative, pioneering businesses gave me an itch to be a part of something.This dovetailed well with my continued enjoyment of programming, and I applied and was accepted to Makers Academy, attracted by its language-agnostic approach and community-driven ethos.


## Skills
[Bio](#how-i-got-here) | [Skills](#skills) | [Education](#education) | [Experience](#experience) | [Sample Projects](#sample-projects) [Interests](#interests)

#### Technical skills
My technical skills come largely from the time I spent at Makers Academy ([see below](#education) for further details and sample projects). Whilst the course is taught primarily in Ruby and JavaScript, Makers' language-agnostic approach to teaching means I feel comfortable learning new languages and technologies on the fly - as I did with Python during our [practice final project](https://github.com/somemarsupials/cooking-challenge).

Beyond languages, I have also worked with a number of other technologies, libraries, and frameworks, including, but not limited to, Rails, Node, PostgreSQL, Jasmine, HTML/CSS, jQuery, and sci-kit learn. I am comfortable working across the full technology stack, and would be more than happy to complete a tech test in an unfamiliar language.


#### Communication
As a linguist throughout my academic career, the import of precise, clear, and concise communication is not lost on me. A combination of essay-writing and Oxford's tutorial system (hour-long sessions of tuition between a tutor and up to four students) helped me develop both my oral and written communication.

At The Up Group, part of my remit was to deliver industry news briefings to the whole company during Monday meetings, allowing me to hone my presentation skills. I was also responsible for elements of new starter training, meaning I had to communicate with people in both an engaging and informative manner, often whilst introducing entry-level starters to entirely new concepts.

Meanwhile, I have found one of the most rewarding parts of group work at Makers Academy to be leading standups and retros. It is incredibly satisfying to be able to facilitate discussion within a group, allowing the whole team to align behind common goals, reflect upon successes and challenges, and ultimately grow together as people and developers.


#### Aptitude for learning
Throughout my life, I have always had an insatiable curiosity that has driven my desire to learn and tackle new challenges. This has manifested itself in everything from teaching myself basic Hindi, to taking on a machine learning challenge as part of my [practice final project](https://github.com/somemarsupials/cooking-challenge) at Makers (and at the same time learning Python from scratch), or developing a deep understanding of the UK's tech ecosystem and becoming the go-to person to talk about new technologies such as blockchain whilst at Up.

Since joining Makers, my approach to learning has become altogether more considered and sophisticated; the curriculum encourages and rewards curiosity, coaches push students to find answers themselves, and reflection is a core part of the experience. As a result, I am a more mature learner, better able to identify my own strengths and weaknesses (both in programming and in life), and take action accordingly.  


#### Getting Stuff Done *(capital G, S, D)*
Throughout my life, I have always placed a heavy emphasis on Getting Stuff Done, no matter how difficult, unpleasant, or monotonous the task. At university, I never once missed a deadline, whilst at The Up Group, I often worked in an ad-hoc way, balancing ongoing projects with immediate incoming tasks.

In practice, this involved lots of management: of time, of stakeholders, and of myself. The end result of this was usually that I completed the task promptly and to a high standard. However, on occasions when either workloads or time frames meant that it would not have been possible for me to complete a task, I worked with colleagues or tutors to ensure that tasks were completed, either at a later date for non-time-sensitive tasks, or with the assistance of someone else with the capacity to do so for urgent ones. A strong work ethic, ruthless prioritisation, and a readiness to be flexible have been absolutely critical in my ability to Get Stuff Done.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2017 - January 2018)
##### Full-stack software development bootcamp
I began at Makers Academy, Europe's leading web developer bootcamp, after having taught myself to code in my spare time for the past year. The course is highly competitive, accepting only 10% of applicants, and places a heavy emphasis on practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and object-oriented design. See Makers' [website](http://www.makersacademy.com/curriculum/) for more on their curriculum.

The course at Makers is highly geared towards self-guided learning, and over the twelve weeks I worked on a number of projects either pair-programming or as part of a team. See [Sample Projects](#sample-projects) for a flavour of these.


#### Somerville College, University of Oxford (October 2012 - June 2016)
##### BA European and Middle Eastern Languages (Spanish & Arabic)
I graduated from Oxford with a 2.i in EMEL (Spanish & Arabic) in June 2016 after a four year course, including a year abroad in Amman, Jordan, where I attended an intensive course in Modern Standard and Classical Arabic. I also spent time in Spain during two summers across my degree, working at a delivery startup and a small healthcare consultancy.

During my degree, I covered a wide and diverse range of historical and literary content in addition to language work, ranging from pre-Islamic poetry to modern Spanish theatre. I also engaged with a wide range of extra-curricular activities, including working as a Section Editor for student media outlet VERSA News, captaining my college's 2nd XI football team, and working as my college JCR's secretary.  


#### Hills Road Sixth-Form College
##### A-Level Studies
During my time at Hills Road, I took full A-Levels in four subjects, achieving an A\* in History, As in Spanish and Government & Politics, and a B in German. I also took on an additional GCSE in Italian in my second year, achieving an A\* grade.


#### Swavesey Village College
##### GCSEs
I took my GCSEs at my local secondary school, Swavesey Village College, achieving nine A\*s, three As, one B, and three Distinctions. I was also awarded the Chair of Governor's Award at the school's awards ceremony for the year group.


## Experience
[Bio](#how-i-got-here) | [Skills](#skills) | [Education](#education) | [Experience](#experience) | [Sample Projects](#sample-projects) [Interests](#interests)

**The Up Group** (June 2016 to October 2017)    
*Research Associate*   
The Up Group is a boutique, digital executive search firm in London. I joined as the company's third attempt at this role, and one that was not yet clearly-defined. In my time at the company, I shaped the role into one that became crucial within the team. By the time I left, I had variously provided training for new starters, helped create new business pitches, built a system to track database quality and pushed to improve it, assisted with searches, delivered weekly news briefings, assisted Finance & Operations with some data analysis tasks, and worked on various other projects besides.


**Somerville College & Rux-Burton Associates** (September 2015 to Ocotber 2015)   
*Annual Fund Caller*   
Somerville College conducts an annual telethon in partnership with Rux-Burton Associates to raise money for the Annual Fund, which is used to finance things like bursaries or investment in facilities. I spent two weeks contacting college alumni to update them on college affairs and request donations to the Annual Fund. The telethon was the college's most successful to date, as I and many of my peers exceeded our targets, at the same time building my confidence and honing my skills in communication, negotiation, and relationship-building.


**Salud y Communicación** (July 2015, Madrid)   
*Intern*   
Salud y Communicación is a small healthcare consultancy in Madrid. Over two weeks, I researched for and compiled a report in Spanish on mechanisms for producing innovation in healthcare in the UK. This project required me to use my research and presentation abilities, in addition to developing my prowess in Spanish.


**IkiOra** (July 2014 to August 2014, Madrid)   
*Intern*
IkiOra was a Madrid-based same-hour delivery startup, similar to UK services Quiqup and Shutl. In my time here, I profiled customers, analysed competition, maintained the product database, drafted press notes, and worked on SEO.


**Jesuit Refugee Services** (March 2014 to May 2014, Amman)   
*English Teacher*   
Jesuit Refugee Services is a global charity for refugees. I volunteered there for three months whilst in Jordan, teaching English to largely Iraqi refugees living in Amman. In this time, I developed my leadership and communication abilities.


**Various Part-Time Work** (2008 to 2015)   
*Waiting, newspaper delivery, farm work*
I have worked part-time jobs consistently since the age of 14, allowing me to develop a strong work ethic and willingness to get stuck in with any task.


## Sample Projects

During my time at [Makers Academy](#education), I worked on various projects. These are all available on my GitHub, and a selection are included below.

**Robot Wars**   
*[Robot Wars](https://github.com/SuzanneHuldt/robot-wars)* was my final project at Makers. Working in a team of four, we built a bot to play a two-player [variation of Conway's Game of Life](https://starapple.riddles.io/competitions/game-of-life-and-death). This was built using exclusively **Ruby** and **RSpec**, a decision taken consciously to avoid the use of external libraries (beyond a testing framework) to allow us to develop as sophisticated a bot as possible from scratch.

**Cooking Up A Storm**   
*[Cooking Up A Storm](https://github.com/somemarsupials/cooking-challenge)* was our practice final project at Makers. Cooking Up A Storm is an application that uses machine learning to recommend the user a style of cuisine to cook, given a  list of ingredients. The app was built primarily in **Python** (with the help of libraries such as **scikit-learn**), with **Sinatra** providing the web framework and **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery** used for some front-end features.

**NightmAirbnb**   
*[NightmAirbnb](https://github.com/cazwazacz/MakersBnB)* was a rebuild of Airbnb, and the first group project that we worked on at Makers (having previously paired on challenges). The application was built using the **Sinatra** web framework, with **Postgres** and **DataMapper** on the back-end, and **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery** on the front-end.

**Leonardo**   
*[Leonardo](https://github.com/peterwdj/leonardo)* is an Instagram clone built using **Rails**. The application is built in Ruby, using **Postgres** and **DataMapper** on the back-end, as well as gems such as **Carrierwave** and **OAuth** to implement image upload and third-party sign-in respectively.

**Oh-Note!**   
*[Oh-Note!](https://github.com/SuzanneHuldt/oh-note)* is a simple notes application built using **JavaScript**. The app was written without the use of any external libraries, save a **http-server**, a lightweight server. This meant that we had to recreate tools such as **jQuery** and the **Jasmine** testing framework from scratch.


## Interests
[Bio](#how-i-got-here) | [Skills](#skills) | [Education](#education) | [Experience](#experience) | [Sample Projects](#sample-projects) [Interests](#interests)

My motivation to learn to code came from another of my passions - startups. I am enthralled by the believers who see opportunities to change the world for the better - and go out and do it. I have cultivated this passion through my work at Up, books such as Brad Stone's *[The Upstarts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Upstarts-Airbnb-Companies-Silicon-Changing/dp/0316396818)* and Ben Horowitz' *[The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205)*, and listening to podcasts such as Reid Hoffman's *[Masters of Scale](https://mastersofscale.com/)* (his [uncut interview with Brian Chesky](https://soundcloud.com/best-of-tech-startups/masters-of-scale-uncut-interview-airbnbs-brian-chesky) is my favourite episode). In recent months, I have discovered and become increasingly interested in Tristan Harris' [Time Well Spent](http://www.timewellspent.io/) movement and, more broadly, how technology can be used to augment, improve, and ultimately liberate our lives, rather than dominate and consume them - a task that will ultimately require more thoughtful, considered, and empathetic design.

Outside of the worlds of technology and entrepreneurship, I have a keen interest in politics, nurtured by my parents from an early age. I also play football three times a week (training and competitively), and have recently taken up yoga and meditation, allowing me to develop an altogether healthier relationship with myself.
